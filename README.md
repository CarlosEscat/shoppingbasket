# Technical assignment back-end engineer

Youâ€™re working on an online shopping platform. The sales team wants to know which items were added to a basket, but removed before checkout. We will use this data later for targeted discounts.

Using PHP, build a shopping basket that helps you get this data.

**Minimal requirements**

* Use PHP

**Scope**

* Focus on API side, not on the interface

**Timing**

You have 3 weeks to accomplish the assignment. You decide yourself how much time and effort you invest in it, but one of our colleagues tends to say: "Make sure it is good" ;-).
Please ping us when you are done, on this endpoint ([Slack incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)): `https://hooks.slack.com/services/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`. Please mention your name and a link to what we need to review.
